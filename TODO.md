# Pending for [sermat.js](https://github.com/LeonardoVal/sermat.js).

## Issues

+ Improve performance of `Sermat.materialize`.

## Testing

+ Make test cases that run with Karma to run also on Node.

+ Test ES6 literal support (multiline delimited by backticks). 

## Improvements

+ Support for extended prototypes (e.g. subclasses) inheriting the `__SERMAT__` spec.
